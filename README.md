# thirsty

Quick exploration of 2d sprite-based engine in c++ based on a quick tech demo.

And yes, "thirsty" is a "sprite" pun, albeit a lame one.

## Inspirations

Specific constraints shaping the design of this demo engine include:

* The elegance of functional stack rendering from intermediate mode graphics

* The simple power of the rendering pipeline in THREE.js

* The idea of enhancing a basic 2d sprite game with specific shader effects
